# gabriel-pickard-on-dungeondraft (WIP)

***If you are looking for the actual assets of Gabriel Pickard, you will not find them here***

Having been a long time fan of Gabriel Pickard i have acquired numerous of his asset packs. 
Up till now i have assembled many battlemaps in inkscape and GIMP. 

- Inkscape allows you to easily make collages and as it just stores links the resulting .svg size is always small. However adapting/clipping individual assets is cumbersome and often requires a adapted version of the image. Also it only exports .pngs that require conversion to a smaller format before uploading to a vtt.
- GIMP is perfect to change individual assets, and if you make a collage each layer can get it's own mask and/or adaptations. However, in my case, .xcf file sizes grow easily over 100MB.

Recently i came to know Dungeon Draft and that program is specialized and much easier to build battlemaps than Inkscape/GIMP.
